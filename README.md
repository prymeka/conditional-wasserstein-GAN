# conditional-wasserstein-GAN
Implementation of Conditional Wasserstein GAN model with Gradient Penalty (cWGAN-GP) in keras.

The architecture requires the input images to be $28\times 28\times 1$, however, it can be easily adapted for other input shapes.

The implementation is largely inspired by [this](https://keras.io/examples/generative/wgan_gp/) tutorial on standard WGAN-GP.
